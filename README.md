## Summary
---
This data has been cleaned and manipulated in a way that allows us to properly analyze the school data. We have removed null values and duplicated rows from the dataset. We have also cleaned up the grade column so we could change the datatype to an interger. We have drilled down into the summary statistics of the data, which allows us to state that the average reading score is 72.4 and the average math score was 64.7; Which suggests that these students are better in the english department, on average, however, the minimum reading score was 10.5. When examining school budgets, it tends to be slightly higher for public schools, where their average is $911,195.56 and charter schools have an average school budget of 872,625.66. The overall average school budget for all schools is $893,742.75. There are 14,831 students in this dataset, most of which are 10th graders. Addtioanlly, Montgomery High School comprises the most of these students, with a total of 2,038 students..followed by Green High school with 1,961 students. On the flipside, Chang High School has the least amount of students with only 171 students. When looking at math scores, Charter schools tend to have higher scores, however, scores tend to drop as the students get older which is interesting to note.
